    Hello! My name is Mykhailo Banasevych and I am the author of this website. Hm... What can I say about myself?
    I am 20. I live in Cracow. I study at the University of Economics in Cracow at the course called Applied Informatics.
    I like playing videogames, reading books and I am fond of history. And also I sometimes do code. It seems that I've
    chosen this kind of activity as my future job.

    (please)
